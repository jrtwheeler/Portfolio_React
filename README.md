  ## Description
  The portfolio website presents my portfolio, my CV, links to my GitHub repo and LinkedIn profile, and a real time example of my ability as a designer and a UI/UX designer. My intention is to use the page both as a portfolio and as a testing ground for ideas from and for other projects. The goal is for the portfolio page to grow with me, as a journal I keep on my coding journey.
